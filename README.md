## Project Description
Develop and deploy a credit scoring model for assessing the creditworthiness of loan applicants. The project involves building a machine learning model, deploying it as a microservice on AWS, and implementing robust monitoring and alerting mechanisms to ensure the reliability and performance of the scoring system.

## Running the Application
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository_url>

2. Install requirements
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   
3. Create virtual environment
   ```bash
   pip install virtualenv
   python -m venv venv
   venv\Scripts\activate

## Docker Pull Command
To pull the latest version of the credit scoring simulator image from Docker Hub, use the following command:

   
      docker pull deepakshandilya/credit-scoring-simulator:latest

## Project Components
### a) Credit Scoring Model Development
- Collect and preprocess historical loan data, including applicant information, credit history, income, and loan performance.
- Train a machine learning model (e.g., logistic regression, random forest) to predict the likelihood of default based on the input features.

### b) Model Deployment as a Microservice
- Containerize the trained model using Docker to encapsulate it as a microservice.
- Set up a scalable and resilient infrastructure on AWS using Kubernetes (EKS) for deploying and managing the model microservice.

### c) API Gateway and ServiceMesh Integration
- Configure an API Gateway (e.g., AWS API Gateway) to expose the credit scoring model as a RESTful API for integration with other systems.
- Implement a service mesh (e.g., Istio) for managing communication between microservices and enforcing security and reliability policies.

### d) Monitoring and Alerting
- Set up comprehensive monitoring and alerting using AWS CloudWatch and Prometheus/Grafana.
- Monitor key metrics such as model performance, latency, and resource utilization to detect anomalies and ensure a timely response to issues.

### e) Data Privacy and Compliance
- Ensure compliance with data privacy regulations (e.g., GDPR, CCPA) by implementing appropriate data access controls and encryption mechanisms.
- Monitor and audit data access to ensure compliance with regulatory requirements.

## Project Goals
- Develop and deploy a credit scoring model as a microservice on AWS, ensuring high availability and reliability.
- Implement robust monitoring and alerting mechanisms to detect and respond to performance issues and anomalies in real-time.
- Ensure compliance with data privacy and regulatory requirements throughout the deployment and operation of the credit scoring system.

## Additional Considerations
- Evaluate the performance of the credit scoring model using real-world loan application data and validate its accuracy and reliability.
- Implement A/B testing to compare the performance of different versions of the credit scoring model and identify opportunities for improvement.
- Document the project's architecture, deployment procedures, and monitoring configurations for knowledge sharing and future reference.
- This project will provide hands-on experience in deploying and managing machine learning models in production environments, addressing challenges related to reliability, performance, and compliance in the context of credit scoring applications.
